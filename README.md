# Redis Integration with Spring Boot


## Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate Redis with Spring Boot for caching and storing data efficiently. The project provides an easy-to-use REST API to interact with Redis for storing and retrieving key-value pairs. We use Jedis as the Redis client, and Spring Data Redis is utilized for seamless integration.

## Features
Set Data: Allows you to set key-value pairs with a timeout.
Get Data: Allows you to retrieve the value associated with a key.
Jedis: Uses Jedis pool for connection management with Redis.
Spring Boot: Leverages the power of Spring Boot for ease of setup and configuration.


## Technologies Used
Java 11
Spring Boot 2.x
Redis (v6.x or higher)
Jedis (v4.x)
Lombok for reducing boilerplate code
